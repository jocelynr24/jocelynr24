jocelyn@routin:~$ Hello, and again, welcome to my profile!
jocelyn@routin:~$ My name is Jocelyn Routin (@jocelynr24) and I am 26 years old.
jocelyn@routin:~$
jocelyn@routin:~$ I live in France and I like to learn new languages.
jocelyn@routin:~$ I learned English and Spanish at school.
jocelyn@routin:~$ But I went a year abroad in the Netherlands.
jocelyn@routin:~$ There, I was able to improve my computer skills enormously.
jocelyn@routin:~$ I also discovered a new culture and a new language.
jocelyn@routin:~$
jocelyn@routin:~$ I am passionate about new technologies in general and video games.
jocelyn@routin:~$ I really enjoy programming and discover new things in computing, such as find new solutions to a problem.
jocelyn@routin:~$ But sometimes, my brain does a 'while(true)' loop, especially when the problem is complex!
jocelyn@routin:~$
jocelyn@routin:~$ Now about my school curriculum, I carried out a technological baccalauréat called STI2D.
jocelyn@routin:~$ Then, during my academic year, I did a DUT GEII.
jocelyn@routin:~$ It is a technological diploma about electrical engineering and industrial computing.
jocelyn@routin:~$ After that, I did a DUETI, this time in PURE computing, in the Netherlands.
jocelyn@routin:~$ Finally, I tried to do a year of licence and professional licence in computing.
jocelyn@routin:~$ I was able to learn a ton of new things, but the format was not appropriate for me...
jocelyn@routin:~$
jocelyn@routin:~$ You can see some of my projects in my various repos on GitHub.
jocelyn@routin:~$ But if you want to discover more, my website is https://jocelyn.routin.net/
jocelyn@routin:~$ Don't worry, it is available in French, English, Spanish and Dutch!
